            Hello and welcome
        </h2>
        <p>
            Who is Hunter Britten? 
            <br></br>
            Well to start I am a twenty-eight year old college graduate from the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication at Washington State University. 
            <br></br>
            I am also a new father to my daughter Charli, which has made life all the more enjoyable. My fiancee can't stop asking me for me for more children for a day. 
            <br></br>
            Nerd who happened to play a lot of sports as a kid is a great way to describe me.
            <br></br>
            I spend most of my time doing the things I love with people I love. From gaming till 2am to scaling volcanos with my closest group of wildboys. I llove to sleep, but I also like to stay up all night at festivals dancing my heart out (though maybe not anymore, thanks Charli).
            <br></br>
            I have been sober for almost six years and it has helped me really get in touch with why I am here and my own spirituality.
            <br></br>
            I love learning new things and meeting new people.
            <br></br>
